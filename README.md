# Web task-International Relations Cell

I have made a Django 3.1 project named "IR_Cell" in which there is an app called "OutboundDiaries".
This app is the required webpage.
To run this web app in your local machine, follow below steps:
- Clone this repository
- Open terminal/command prompt
- cd into the cloned repository containing the "manage.py" file via terminal
- Run ```python manage.py runserver```
- Open any web browser (google chrome is recommended)
- Open the url ```127.0.0.1:8000``` in the browser
